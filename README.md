# Prediction of Heart desease

## Task:
To predict the Heart desease patients depending on the data. 

## Criteria:
There were 72 attributes in te original data. But previous analysis shows that the contribution of these 14 attributes (Ex. Age,Sex, Cholesterol level, Maximum heart beat etc.)are the most in predicting the heart desease. 

It is a classification problem. So I have checked different algorithms to find out the best accuracy.
